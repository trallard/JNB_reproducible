# Jupyter notebooks for reproducible research

This repository contains the materials for the Jupyter notebooks for reproducible research at the [Second RSE conference ](http://rse.ac.uk/conf2017/).

The workshop is completely self contained and should be easily adapted/extended for future workshops. Feel free to raise issues.

A suitable environment is provided in the form of a Docker container.

The slides are built using reveal.js and can be served locally following the instructions shown [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

Alternatively the web hosted version of the slides can be found [here]().
