- We created this Etherpad for the workshop: [https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/RSE-reproNB](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/RSE-reproNB)

- Follow the instructions given in the learner's instructions file: [https://goo.gl/DB6XEb](https://goo.gl/DB6XEb)



## Why do we care so much about software sustainability?

* Will my code still be used in 5-10 years? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Can my software be found? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How easily can others use/maintain my software? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How does my software impact <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <accent-text> research</accent-text> ?



## We are <strong> Research</strong> software engineers
In research, experiments/results are not trusted unless:
- The experimental setup is <strong>tested</strong>
- The method is <strong> well-documented </strong>
- We can demonstrate that our results are <strong> reproducible  and reliable</strong>



## <display-text>So why would scientific software be any different?</display-text>
It should follow sustainable practices (e.g. version control, testing, continuous integration, code coverage)

and we should not trust results obtained from
codes without proper testing and/or documentation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->



## Are we changing research?
More and more research groups are concerned about reproducibility
in computational areas/science.
