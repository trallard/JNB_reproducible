# Onboarding for OOOminders

This is your jumping point to get you up and running with your computational work as an OOOminder.

(Please note that this is still a work in progress and you can help to make this a better onboarding experience for those that come after you!)

This repository contains some resources and will help us to keep rack of the work being developed as part of the project. It will as well, serve as the main point of technical contact between you and your RSE.

Don't worry if I have already used loads of words you have never heard before... you will get familiar with all of this sooner than you think.


## Getting you up and running

The main point of access to get licensed software as a PhD student or staff at the university of Sheffield is via the [CiCS software website](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/software/).

Head there and request the following software:
- MATLAB
- Intel Parallel Studio XE Composer

Make sure you are logged into your MUSE account first.

Head to [https://www.visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com) and get the Visual Studio community edition (Make sure you get the community edition!!!)
