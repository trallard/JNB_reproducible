# Onboarding for OOOminders

This is your jumping point to get you up and running with your computational work as an OOOminder.

(Please note that this is still a work in progress and you can help to make this a better onboarding experience for those that come after you!)

This repository contains some resources and will help us to keep rack of the work being developed as part of the project. It will as well, serve as the main point of technical contact between you and your RSE.

Don't worry if I have already used loads of words you have never heard before... you will get familiar with all of this sooner than you think.


## Getting you up and running
You will be needing a lot of software to be installed... we tried to gather a sensible amount of resources that will get you going for now.

### Site licensed software

The main point of access to get licensed software as a PhD student or staff at the university of Sheffield is via the [CiCS software website](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/software/).

Head there and request the following software:
- MATLAB
- Intel Parallel Studio XE Composer

Make sure you are logged into your MUSE account first.

Head to [https://www.visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com) and get the Visual Studio community edition (Make sure you get the community edition!!!)

### Open Source software

As you have noticed all of this information is stored in a repository within GitHub. For now think of it as a project folder which contains all of the project files and stores each files revision history.

- **Git** is what we will be using for version control for all the software we will develop over the course of this project. So go to [the git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and install in in your computer.
- You will need a text editor as well. We recommend [Atom ](https://atom.io) as this integrates really well with Git and is a rather flexible and customisable editor. If you prefer any other (Notepad ++, vim, sublime) go ahead and make sure you have this installed.
